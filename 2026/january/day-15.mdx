## The "Vibe Coding" Session: A Deep Dive into Internals
Today wasn't about building features; it was about understanding the machine. We peeled back the layers of React Native to understand exactly how a `.tsx` file becomes a pixel on an Android screen.

We restructured the entire learning path into a **Self-Questioning Journey**, mapping high-level guesses to deep architectural reality.

## 🔍 The Journey: Questions & Breakthroughs

### 1. The Startup (OS Layer)
*   **Question:** Does the parent create the activity and load the JS?
*   **Concept:** `super.onCreate(null)` is the "Power Switch."
*   **Code:**
    ```kotlin
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        setTheme(R.style.AppTheme) // 🎨 Splash Screen
        super.onCreate(null)       // 🪟 Start RN Logic
    }
    ```
*   **Insight:** `setTheme` runs native code instantly. `super.onCreate` reserves the physical window and initiates the Hermes engine startup.

### 2. The Handshake (Identification)
*   **Question:** How does the OS know which JS file to run?
*   **Concept:** The `getMainComponentName` method returns a "Key" (String) that must match the AppRegistry key in JS.
*   **Code:**
    ```kotlin
    override fun getMainComponentName(): String = "main"
    ```
*   **Insight:** Expo Router implicitly registers `index.tsx` as `"main"`. This string is the bridge header.

### 3. The Manager (Delegate Pattern)
*   **Question:** Who manages the engine and the UI?
*   **Concept:** The `ReactActivityDelegate`. It is the "Manager" hired by the Activity.
*   **Code:**
    ```kotlin
    override fun createReactActivityDelegate(): ReactActivityDelegate {
        return ReactActivityDelegateWrapper(...)
    }
    ```
*   **Insight:** The Delegate has three jobs:
    1.  Create the `ReactRootView` (native container).
    2.  Start the Hermes Runtime.
    3.  Load the Root Component into the view.

### 4. The Translation (Bridge/Fabric)
*   **Question:** Does Hermes draw the button?
*   **Concept:** No. Hermes calculates logic and builds a "Virtual Tree" (Shadow Tree).
*   **Insight:**
    *   **Brain (Hermes):** "I need a blue button here."
    *   **Nervous System (Bridge):** Transmits the instruction.
    *   **Body (Android):** Instantiates `android.widget.Button`.
*   **Reality:** JS code never turns into XML. It turns into *imperative native commands* that create objects in memory.

## The Mental Model: "Brain vs. Body"
We solidified the ultimate analogy:
*   **Hermes** is the **Thinking Brain** (Logic, State, Calculus).
*   **The Bridge** is the **Nervous System** (Signals).
*   **Android** is the **Physical Body** (Rendering pixels, handling touches).

## Summary
We moved from "React Native is magic" to "React Native is a conversation between a JS engine and an Android host."
We now know exactly what happens between the icon tap and the first pixel appearing on screen.
