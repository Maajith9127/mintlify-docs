# February 3rd, 2026

**The Blueprint is Locked. Now We Build.**

After weeks of preparation, the full implementation roadmap is now clear. Here are the whiteboard notes that capture the plan:

## 🗓️ Week 1: Core Task & Scheduling Logic

This week is about the **backbone** of CommitT: creating tasks, storing recurrence rules, and making sure alarms survive device restarts.

### 1. Create Task Flow

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | User creates a Commitment/Task | Store: Title, Description, Conditions |
| 2 | Store Recurrence Rule | Daily/Weekly/Custom + interval + end condition |
| 3 | Create First Task Instance | Calculate next occurrence from recurrence rule |
| 4 | Schedule Local Alarm | Use Android AlarmManager to wake user at task start time (must persist across restarts!) |
| 5 | Schedule Proof Collection | At task end time, trigger validation logic |
| 6 | Start Location Service (if opted) | Begin sending GPS to backend OR just do a single check-in |

### 2. During Active Task Window

| Condition Type | What Happens |
|----------------|--------------|
| Full Time Interval | Continuously send location to backend + store locally |
| Check-in Only | Send GPS once at start, verify on backend, done |

### 3. Task Completion / End of Instance

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Validate proofs (location, photo, etc.) |
| 2 | Mark instance as `verified` / `missed` / `waived` |
| 3 | Create next Task Instance (from recurrence rule) |
| 4 | Schedule the next alarm + proof collection |

### 4. Update Task Flow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Delete/Update current pending Task Instance |
| 2 | Update the Recurrence Rule in DB |
| 3 | Re-run instance creation logic (same as create flow) |
| 4 | Reschedule local alarms & location services |

### ⚠️ Critical: Alarm Persistence

> **Alarms must survive device restarts.**
> 
> Use `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver + re-register alarms on boot.

This was already implemented in January (Day 14) with the `withBootReceiver` config plugin. We have the foundation; now we wire it to real tasks.

## 🗓️ Weeks 2 & 3: Social Network Graph

This is where CommitT becomes **"Social Stikk"**.

- Build the social/friend system (add, remove, accept invites)
- Allow assigning tasks to accountability partners
- Visibility controls (public / private / friends-only)
- Proof-of-work feed (friends see your check-ins, can react)

---

## 🗓️ Week 4: App Block Features (App B - Digital Commitment)

This is the **"make cheating irrational"** layer.

- Detect app launches (Accessibility Service)
- Block specified apps during task windows
- Show overlay / force return to home screen
- "Request Unlock" flow → all partners must approve

---

## 🗓️ Week 5: Penalty & Waiver

The **stakes** that make it real.

**Penalty Options (implement at least one):**
- Monetary (forfeit ₹X)
- Streak loss (reset counter)
- Embarrassing photo sent to partners

**Waiver Options (implement at least one):**
- Solve 100 CAPTCHAs
- Write a 3000-word reflection
- Complete a harder replacement task
- Grace period (1 free miss per month)

---

## Next Step

**Today:** Start implementing Week 1 - Create Task Flow.

This means:
1. Backend: Convex mutations for creating tasks with recurrence rules.
2. Frontend: Wire the existing UI to call those mutations.
3. Native: Ensure AlarmManager schedules the first instance.

Let's ship.
