# January 2nd, 2026

> Collaboration isn’t about writing code together. It’s about aligning mental models early.

**What actually happened between me and Atheeq (and why it got so confusing so fast)**

When we started CommitT, I genuinely thought we were arguing about UI flow.

Like:
- Should the user see conditions first?
- Should they land on a summary page?
- Is V1 simpler or V2 cleaner?
- Are there too many pages or too many buttons?

That’s what it looked like.

But looking back now, that wasn’t the real problem at all.

The real problem was this:
**We were both building the same product, but from two completely different mental starting points — and neither of us said that out loud early enough.**

---

## The "V1 vs V2" Debate

On the surface, our arguments kept circling around very specific things:

### Atheeq’s Version (V1)
In Atheeq’s version, the user:
1. Clicks add
2. Goes into a conditions page
3. Adds time
4. Adds location
5. Saves
6. Moves forward step by step

### My Version (V2)
In my version, the user:
1. Clicks add
2. Lands directly on a summary page
3. Sees everything in one place
4. Clicks Time → edits → Save → comes back
5. Clicks Location → edits → Save → comes back
6. Same for penalty, digital block, proofs

<video controls src="../pow/maajithversion(V2).mp4" width="100%"></video>

People kept saying things like:
- “This one feels simpler”
- “That one feels cleaner”
- “Yours looks better”
- “His feels more understandable”

And honestly, the more people we asked, the worse it got. Every new opinion just pushed us in a different direction.

## What Atheeq was actually assuming

Atheeq was thinking like a **system designer** first. Even when he talked about UI, what he really cared about was order and logic.

His mental model was:
> “We are building a system. A system must have a clear start, middle, and end.”

So in his head:
- A task starts somewhere
- Conditions are added one by one
- Each page has one responsibility
- When you save Time, you are done with Time
- Time and location are conditions
- Proofs, camera, accountability partner are verification mechanisms, not conditions

From his side, my flow felt **unordered**. It looked like jumping around instead of progressing.

---

## What I was assuming

I was thinking almost entirely from a **user-experience-first** angle.

My internal logic was:
> “Users don’t think in schemas or steps. They think in control and outcomes.”

So in my head:
- The summary page is the real source of truth
- Every other page is just an editor
- Navigation should be a loop, not a straight line
- Edit → Save → Back feels safe and reversible
- Seeing everything together reduces anxiety

This is exactly how apps like AppBlock (10M+ users) work. To me, jumping back to summary after saving time felt natural. State management felt non-negotiable.

---

## Why this slowly turned into frustration

Neither of us was wrong. Neither of us explained our assumptions early. We were judging each other using our own internal logic.

- He felt my flow had no structure.
- I felt his flow was too rigid.
- Both of us felt the other was “missing something obvious”.

Asking more users didn’t resolve anything; feedback became contradictory, and discussions felt endless.

---

## The Big Misunderstanding: “Condition vs Proof”

This was the moment where things almost snapped — but also where clarity started.

Atheeq said:
> “Accountability partner / proof ≠ condition”

From a backend, textbook perspective — he’s right. But what I meant by “condition” was different.

In my head:
A condition is what success should look like. When a user uploads a photo of their gym, they are saying: *“At this time, at this location — this is what counts as success.”*

Later, when AI asks to *“Match this environment”*, that uploaded photo isn’t just proof. It’s a **reference constraint**.

Once that clicked, a lot of tension dropped. It wasn't logic; it was **naming and framing**.

---

## The State Management Fight

Atheeq initially felt we didn’t need state management. Backend schema already defines truth, and frontend just sends data.

I pushed back hard because:
- Frontend and backend must evolve independently
- A task draft must exist before final validation
- Pages should never own truth — the draft should

That’s why I built the **Zustand store**: One draft, all pages mutate it, validation only happens at “Commit”. This was about long-term sanity.

---

## What we actually converged on

We didn’t sit down and say “okay, this is the final philosophy”, but we naturally landed on a fusion:

1. **Linear logic from Atheeq**: Clear start/end, clean backend.
2. **Summary-loop UX from me**: Summary page as the hub, no forced order unless required.
3. **Clearer conceptual separation**: Conditions = success constraints, Verification = how we check them.

---

## The Biggest Lesson

Collaboration is about **aligning mental models early**. 

Most startups die because assumptions stay unspoken, people feel misunderstood, and discussions turn into power struggles.

This happened just one month into development, which is a good thing. Now I understand how Atheeq thinks, he understands how I think, and we know where our communication failed.

> “We weren’t arguing about UI or backend. We were arguing because we started from two different mental models and assumed the other person saw the world the same way.”

Once we realized that, the solution wasn’t choosing V1 or V2. It was **combining structure with flexibility**.
