# December 29th, 2025

I was so happy that things were a bit fast today and smooth. It felt like everything was finally clicking into place.

## The Map Breakthrough

The highlight of today was definitely the maps. They finally started working! After some troubleshooting, we successfully managed to:

1.  **Fetch from Google Maps**: The maps are now correctly integrated and loading.
2.  **Enabled Satellite View**: We got the map ID and enabled the satellite imagery view, which looks great.
3.  **Stability**: We've finalized and stabilized the maps in general.

### Current State
For now, the plain maps just exist. We haven't added any specific features like markers, geofencing, or custom overlays yet. They are just there, fetched from Google Maps, and our next step will be to "tame" them for CommitT's specific use cases.
