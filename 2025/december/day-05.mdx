**The Android Build That Refused to Build**

Today was supposed to be the day I finally got the Android build working. Six hours later, I'm writing this with zero successful builds and a very clear understanding of why.

Let me walk you through the entire disaster.

---

## 6:00 PM — Starting Fresh

I was already frustrated with the old environment. Nothing was working properly, so I decided to nuke everything and start clean.

Deleted folders. Reset native code. Reinstalled dependencies.

The classic "maybe if I start fresh it'll magically work" approach.

Spoiler: it did not magically work.

---

## 6:10 PM — Setting Up WSL

Opened Ubuntu on WSL. First task: get my Android phone detected.

```bash
adb devices
```

Nothing. Empty list. Great start.

So I went through the whole ritual:
- Installed ADB
- Enabled USB debugging on phone
- Added USB rules
- Restarted the adb server

Eventually the device showed up. Small win. At least something was working.

---

## 6:40 PM — Preparing to Build

Navigated to the project folder:

```
/mnt/c/CommitT/mono/apps/native
```

Ran the build command:

```bash
bun x expo run:android
```

And so began the long chain of build processes that would consume my entire evening.

---

## 6:50 PM — Gradle Download Starts

Gradle started downloading:

```
gradle-8.14.3.zip
```

This took forever. The download crawled. Sometimes it just sat there doing nothing.

After about 20 minutes, it finally finished and the actual Android build started.

I thought the hard part was over. I was wrong.

---

## 7:15 PM — Break

Took a break. Came back later with the intention of finishing everything tonight.

Famous last words.

---

## 8:00 PM — Build Attempt 1

Restarted the command:

```bash
bun x expo run:android
```

Gradle started building from scratch. Progress bar moved: 30%... 40%... 60%... 80%...

Then the warnings started appearing:

```
Hard link failed. Doing a slower copy instead.
```

This happened over and over. CMake tasks. NDK-related stuff. All complaining about hard links.

I ignored it. Surely it would still work, right?

---

## 8:40 PM — Stuck at 83%

The build hit 83% and just... stopped.

Slowly crawled to 90%. Terminal kept showing:

```
IDLE IDLE IDLE
```

Gradle was not progressing. I sat there for 15-20 minutes watching nothing happen.

This is the developer equivalent of watching paint dry, except the paint is also on fire.

---

## 9:20 PM — No Movement

Still stuck:

```
90% EXECUTING [32m ...]
```

By now it was obvious something in the native build was blocked. Those hard-link warnings weren't just warnings — they were the problem.

Working inside `/mnt/c` on WSL means Windows filesystem. Windows filesystem doesn't properly support hard links. Every hard link operation was falling back to slow copies.

---

## 9:45 PM — Restarting the Attempt

Killed the stuck process. Restarted Ubuntu. Tried everything again:
- Verified `adb devices`
- Reconnected phone
- Checked debugging was on

Everything looked fine. The problem wasn't the device.

---

## 10:00 PM — Build Attempt 2

Ran it again:

```bash
bun x expo run:android
```

Same slow process. Same warnings:

```
Hard link failed. Doing slower copy instead.
```

This confirmed it. WSL + Windows filesystem was the root problem. Not my code. Not Expo. Not my phone.

The environment itself was broken for this use case.

---

## 10:30 PM — BIOS Accident

While switching between screens, I accidentally entered BIOS.

Panicked for a second. Exited safely. Continued.

Just another thing to add to the chaos of this evening.

---

## 11:00 PM — Stuck Again

Build reached the exact same state:

```
90% EXECUTING [43m ...]
```

Frozen. Repeated "IDLE" messages.

This proved the issue was consistent. Not random. Not a fluke. The same thing happened every single time at the same point.

---

## 11:30 PM — Realization

I started questioning everything.

Every step felt like it was working against me. The setup inside `/mnt/c` was never going to allow this build to complete. The filesystem limitations were fundamental, not fixable with workarounds.

Six hours in, and I was no closer to a working build than when I started.

---

## 12:00 AM — The Final Failure

Gradle finally gave up:

```
Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly
```

The daemon timed out and crashed. Final confirmation that this environment is not stable enough for Android native builds.

I just stared at the screen. Six hours. Nothing to show for it.

---

## Root Cause

Here's what actually went wrong:

1. Project was inside `/mnt/c` on WSL
2. Android NDK requires hard links
3. Hard links don't work properly on `/mnt/c` (Windows filesystem)
4. WSL converts hard links into slow fallback copies
5. Native builds take forever and freeze around 90%
6. Gradle daemon eventually times out and crashes

**Nothing was wrong with my code.**
**Nothing was wrong with Expo.**
**Nothing was wrong with my device.**

The environment setup was the only thing blocking the build.

---

## 12:30 AM — End of Day

After more than six hours of trying, deleting, reinstalling, debugging, reconnecting devices, analyzing logs, and sitting through multiple freezes — the build did not complete.

But now I finally know exactly why.

Tomorrow's plan: move the project to the native Linux filesystem inside WSL, not `/mnt/c`. That should fix everything.

Today was painful. But at least it wasn't wasted. I learned something.

That's the whole point of building in public. Even the failures get documented.

See you tomorrow.
