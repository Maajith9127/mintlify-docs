# December 22nd, 2025

**The Day We Built Intent, Pressure, and Structure**

Today didn't start like a normal dev day. Before touching any code, we made a conscious decision: finish one thing properly. That choice shaped everything that followed.

---

## The Conscious Pause

**Q: What was different about today's approach?**

Normally, development starts with opening the editor and building the next feature. Today, we stopped first.

The realization: *"If we keep building randomly, CommitT will slowly become just another productivity app."*

That was concerning because CommitT is not supposed to feel like a habit tracker or an app blocker.

**Q: What did we do before coding?**

We listed everything the app eventually needs:

- Verification
- Alarms that work after restart
- Maps
- Strict mode
- Penalties
- Waivers
- Payments

But instead of trying to do everything, we made a decision: *today, we will finish just one thing properly — Start Verification.*

That choice shaped the entire day.

---

## The Initial Problem

**Q: What was wrong with the initial verification UI?**

Initially, the verification UI looked very similar to app blockers. There were buttons like **Timer** and **Manual Check**, and even though it worked, something felt off.

**Q: Why did it feel wrong?**

It felt like we were giving the user *options* at the moment when there should be **no negotiation**.

The UI was treating verification as a setting, when it should be something else entirely.

---

## The Realization: Verification as Commitment Checkpoint

**Q: What is verification, really?**

Verification is not a setting. It's a **commitment checkpoint**.

**Q: What should the user see right before they're held accountable?**

Not controls. Not explanations.

They should see the **terms they already agreed to**.

This was the key insight: at the moment of verification, the user shouldn't be making new decisions. They should be reminded of the decision they already made.

---

## Redesigning the Verification Card

**Q: How did we redesign the Verification Card?**

We redesigned it to show facts, not explanations:

- **Gym**
- **6:00–7:00**
- **₹500**
- **CAPTCHAS**

No sentences. No "this means if you fail then…". Just facts.

Like a contract summary.

**Q: Why does this matter?**

At a glance, the user knows: *I agreed to go to the gym between 6 and 7, I have ₹500 at stake, and the only waiver is CAPTCHAS.*

At that moment, CommitT stopped feeling like an app that *helps* you, and started feeling like an app that **expects something from you**.

This is the difference between a productivity tool and a commitment system.

---

## The Entire Card as Decision

**Q: How did we simplify the interaction?**

Instead of making the user click a specific button like "Start Verification", we realized something simpler and stronger: **the entire card itself should be the decision**.

**Q: What does this mean in practice?**

If you tap anywhere on that card, you're saying *"I'm entering verification mode."*

The button inside becomes just a visual cue, not the real action.

**Q: Why is this better?**

We made the entire Verification Card pressable. The inner buttons were made non-interactive — just indicators. One tap anywhere = no confusion, no half-commitment.

This removes ambiguity. There's no "maybe I'll start verification" — there's only "I'm entering verification" or "I'm not."

---

## The Architectural Decision: Route Separation

**Q: Where does verification belong in the app structure?**

This was a big architectural moment. Verification doesn't belong in creation. It doesn't belong in settings. Those are places where you tweak things. Verification is **execution**.

**Q: What did we create?**

We created a separate route group:

```
(verify-commit)
```

**Q: Why does this matter?**

That single decision quietly enforced a rule:

- Before this route → you can edit, adjust, rethink
- Inside this route → you only **do**

No renegotiation. No editing penalties mid-way.

That separation is subtle, but it's the backbone of the product.

This architectural choice enforces the psychological boundary between planning and execution.

---

## The Classic Dev Moment

**Q: What went wrong initially?**

Everything looked perfect, but tapping the card did nothing. At first glance it felt broken, but it wasn't a logic issue at all.

**Q: What were the actual problems?**

Two small mistakes caused it:

1. Routing to `/index` instead of the group path
2. Placing a pressable card inside a header component that was swallowing touch events

**Q: How did we fix it?**

Once we fixed those — moved the card out of the header and routed correctly — suddenly it worked. Tap the card, verification page opens.

**Q: Why did this moment matter?**

That moment mattered more than it looked. Because that's when the flow became **real**.

The architecture was correct, but the implementation details were blocking the user experience. Fixing those details made the entire concept functional.

---

## What We Actually Built

**Q: What did we actually build today?**

By the end of the day, we didn't build alarms, or camera verification, or backend logic.

But we built something more fundamental: the **line between planning and execution**.

**Q: What does this mean for CommitT?**

CommitT now has a clear moment where the user crosses over:

- Before that moment, the app is flexible
- After that moment, the app is strict

**Q: What did we actually build?**

Not UI. Not navigation.

We built **intent**, **pressure**, and **structure**.

**Q: Why does this make CommitT different?**

And that's why CommitT now genuinely feels different from an app blocker.

An app blocker is a tool you use. CommitT is a system you enter into.

The difference is in the architecture of commitment, not just the features.

---

## The Verdict

**Q: What was the real achievement today?**

Today we built the psychological and architectural foundation for verification.

We didn't just add a feature — we created a boundary. A moment of transition. A point of no return.

Before verification: planning, adjustment, flexibility.

After verification: execution, accountability, structure.

That boundary is what makes CommitT feel like a commitment system, not just another productivity app.

---

## Proof of Work

The verification flow is now architecturally separated and psychologically distinct. The user experience enforces commitment through structure, not just through features.
