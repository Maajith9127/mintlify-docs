# December 20th, 2025

**The Real Blocker Wasn't Maps — It Was Money**

On the third day, we stopped touching code. We stared at Google Cloud Console instead.

And we found what no tutorial clearly tells you.

---

## The Discovery

**Q: What did we find?**

<Warning>
**UPI / GPay does NOT work for Google Maps SDK billing**
</Warning>

Even though:
- Billing status showed **Active**
- APIs were **Enabled**
- Console didn't throw visible errors

---

## The Silent Block

**Q: How does Google actually handle this?**

Google silently blocks map tile serving unless:

1. You add an **international Visa or MasterCard**
2. With **auto-payment / e-mandate enabled**
3. **RBI-compliant recurring payments** allowed

---

## What We Tried

**Q: Did you try other cards?**

Yes. I even tried my brother's Visa card.

It failed too — because auto-debit wasn't enabled on that card.

---

## The Clarity Moment

<Note>
**The map wasn't broken. The setup wasn't wrong. The payment method was.**
</Note>

But for the first time in three days, I had clarity.

It still hasn't started working yet — but at least now I have hope.

---

## The India-Specific Gotcha

**Q: Why is this especially painful for Indian developers?**

| Payment Method | Works for Maps SDK? |
|----------------|---------------------|
| UPI / GPay | ❌ No |
| Indian debit card | ❌ Usually no |
| Visa/MC without auto-debit | ❌ No |
| Visa/MC with e-mandate | ✅ Yes |

Your billing account can show "Active" while still silently blocking API calls.

**The payment method matters more than the status badge.**

---

## Technical Summary

For anyone hitting the same wall:

```
Problem: Google Maps shows blank grey tiles
Error: INVALID_ARGUMENT – Authorization Failed
Root Cause: Indian payment methods (UPI/GPay) don't work for Maps SDK billing

Solution:
1. Add international Visa/MasterCard to billing
2. Enable auto-debit / e-mandate on the card
3. Ensure RBI-compliant recurring payments are allowed
```

## What These Three Days Taught Me

**Q: What are the key lessons?**

1. A blank map doesn't mean a frontend bug
2. Logs matter more than assumptions
3. Cloud platforms fail silently, especially billing
4. India-specific payment rules can break global services
5. Building real things feels lonely before it feels rewarding

---

## Where I Am Now

It still isn't working.

But now I know why.

And that's enough to keep going.

Because these three days weren't wasted — they taught me things no quick tutorial or exam ever did.

---

## Summary

Today was the breakthrough:
- Stopped touching code, started reading billing console
- Discovered UPI/GPay doesn't work for Maps SDK
- Understood why "Active" billing can still block tile serving

The key insight: **Google Maps fails silently when billing trust is missing. No errors, no logs, just grey.**

Next step: Get a card with auto-debit enabled and verify billing properly.

---

## The Verdict

**We did everything right technically.**

This wasn't a dev mistake — it was:
> India-specific payment infrastructure colliding with Google's global billing requirements

Three days. One grey map. Zero code bugs.

Sometimes the hardest bugs aren't in your code at all.
