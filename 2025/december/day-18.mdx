# December 18th, 2025

**The Day Results Came — And the Map Stayed Grey**

Today was supposed to be about fixing Google Maps. Instead, it became about something bigger.

I got my semester results. And I came to know that I fucked up all the academic CGPA I had — for my passion in this project.

---

## The Context

**Q: Why does this matter?**

I'm still in college.

And instead of optimizing for grades, I've been putting everything into building a real project — something that actually works outside exams and PDFs.

Not because I'm careless. Not because I don't try.

But because I stopped playing the academic game and started spending my time debugging real systems.

Today, the results confirmed what I already knew: **the trade-off was real.**

---

## The Technical Goal

**Q: What were we trying to fix?**

The Google Maps integration from yesterday. Grey tiles. No satellite view. Everything configured correctly — but the map refused to render.

We decided to start fresh and verify every single step.

---

## What We Verified (Again)

**Q: What did we check?**

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| SHA-1 fingerprint generated | ✅ |
| Package name verified | ✅ |
| applicationId matches APK | ✅ |
| APK properly built and signed | ✅ |
| Maps SDK for Android enabled | ✅ |
| Billing account attached | ✅ |
| API key injected correctly | ✅ |

Everything checked out. Every guide said we were doing it right.

---

## The Commands We Ran

```bash
# Verified SHA-1 fingerprint
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey

# Checked package name matches Google Cloud Console
# Verified API key in AndroidManifest.xml
# Rebuilt APK multiple times
```

---

## The Result

<Warning>
**Blank grey map tile.**

No crash. No warning. Just silence.
</Warning>

At first, I assumed it was a small config mistake. Something minor.

But the hours passed. Then the day passed.

By night, I wasn't tired — I just felt dumb.

---

## The Emotional Reality

**Q: How did it feel?**

Honestly? Like shit.

I got my results today. My CGPA tanked. And the thing I sacrificed it for — this project — was showing me a grey rectangle.

No validation from academics. No progress on the project.

Just me, a terminal, and a blank map.

---

## End of Day 1

No progress. No answers. Just a grey rectangle where a map should be.

Tomorrow we go deeper — into the logs.

---

## Summary

Today was brutal on two fronts:
- Results came in — CGPA fucked
- Google Maps stayed grey despite perfect setup

The key question: **If everything is configured correctly, why isn't it working?**

Tomorrow we stop guessing and start reading logs.
