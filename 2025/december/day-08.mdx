# December 8th, 2025

**The Day Classes Won**

Had classes from 8 AM to 7 PM today. By the time I got back, my brain was basically mush.

Didn't do much coding. Just added some proof-of-work screenshots to the docs and called it a day.

Sometimes you just have to accept that not every day is a 12-hour coding marathon. Classes exist. Sleep exists. Life exists.

Tomorrow we go harder.

## What Actually Happened

- 8 AM - 7 PM: Classes (the real enemy of productivity)
- Evening: Added POW screenshots to documentation
- Night: Accepted defeat and went to sleep like a normal human

## Proof of Work

Screenshots added to show the current state of CommitT UI.

That's it. Short entry. Back to building tomorrow.
