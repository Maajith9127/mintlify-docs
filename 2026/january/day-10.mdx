## 5:00 AM: The Founder's Panic

Exhaustion does strange things to the brain.

At 5 AM, with zero sleep and classes looming at 8 AM, my brain broke.

### 1. The Greedy Spiral
"The market is too small!" my tired brain screamed. "I need more money!"
I started inventing problems:
- "Charge $25/month!" (Pricing out the very students I want to help).
- "Pivot to Rich People!" (Trying to sell to executives I don't understand).

It was pure anxiety masquerading as strategy. I wanted to extract value before I had even created any.

### 2. The Reality Check
I had to be talked off the ledge.
- **The Truth:** $5/month from 10K people is better than $25/month from nobody.
- **The Mission:** Help people like *me* (students, strugglers), not hypothetical rich executives.
- **The Survival:** I had class in 3 hours. I had to sleep.

### 3. The Breakthrough: Inverting the Funnel

After a few hours of crash-sleep, clarity hit. The final piece of the puzzle.

**The Problem with Habit Apps:** They are reactive. You fail -> You feel bad -> You quit.
**The Solution:** Be predictive. Catch the quit *before* it happens.

**The New Model: Motivation First.**
Most apps: `Track Habits` (Boring) -> `Maybe get motivation` (Rare).
**CommitT:** `Infinite Motivation Feed` (Addictive) -> `Commit to Action` (Paid).

**The Vision:**
- **Free Tier:** A TikTok/Reels-style feed of *pure* high-agency motivation (Goggins, Huberman, Ali, Regional Indian content).
- **The Hook:** You get addicted to the *identity* of being a high-performer.
- **The Upgrade:** When you're pumped but keep failing, you pay to *lock it in* with Commits (Consequences).

### 4. The Path Forward

No more research. No more market sizing.
**Phase 1:** Build the Feed.
- Curate 50 clips (Goggins, Tyson, Regional).
- Embed them (Free & Legal).
- Test if people scroll.

This is no longer just a "tracker." It's a **Transformation OS**.
And I'm building it.
