# Hey, I'm Abdul Maajith

I'm building CommitT — an app that forces you to keep your promises to yourself.

Here's the problem: I kept saying "I'll wake up at 5 AM" and then waking up at 9. I said "I'll go to the gym" and then watched YouTube for 3 hours. Classic.

So I built something that makes it genuinely painful to break commitments. Not motivational quotes. Not reminders. Actual consequences.

---

## What is CommitT?

CommitT is an app where you make a promise, and the app makes sure you keep it using:

- Live photo/video verification
- Randomised challenges (so you can't fake it)
- Money penalties (yes, real money)
- Accountability partners (social pressure works)
- App blocking (Instagram can wait)
- AI verification (no screenshots allowed)
- Strict mode (can't uninstall when things get hard)

Basically: if you say you'll do something, the app MAKES you do it. If you don't, you pay.

---

## How it actually works

Let me walk you through a real example.

**The commitment:** Wake up at 5 AM for 30 days.

**Step 1: You create the task**

```
Habit: Wake up at 5 AM
Repeat: Daily
Verification: Live Photo
Penalty: Rs.300
Duration: 30 days
```

You also set "randomised verification" between 5:00 AM and 5:15 AM. The app picks a random minute in that window so you can't game it.

**Step 2: The app schedules everything**

CommitT calculates tomorrow's challenge time (say, 5:07 AM), schedules the job, and your phone now shows: "Next verification: 5:07 AM tomorrow."

**Step 3: 5:07 AM hits**

Your phone vibrates. A modal pops up:

```
Live Photo Challenge
Take a picture showing yourself + today's challenge pattern.
Timer: 60 seconds
```

A random visual challenge appears — like "Show 2 fingers near your face" or "Hold your water bottle."

You have 60 seconds. Front camera only. No screenshots.

**Step 4: You take the photo**

Image + challenge + timestamp goes to the backend.

**Step 5: Backend verifies**

The system checks:
- Moire pattern detection (AI) — ensures you didn't photograph another screen
- Challenge match — ensures your pose/object is correct
- Time check — ensures it was within the 60 second window

Pass = verified. Fail = penalty.

**Step 6: Results**

If you woke up: green block on your calendar. Nice.

If you slept through it: Rs.300 deducted from your wallet. You wake up annoyed but slightly more disciplined.

**Step 7: Accountability partner gets notified**

If you added a friend, they see when you fail. They see your history. You can't hide.

Social pressure is brutal but effective.

**Step 8: Month summary**

After 30 days you get:
- Total successful days
- Total penalties paid
- Streak data
- Performance graph

And hopefully, a new habit.

## The Nuclear Stakes (for when money isn't scary enough)

Sometimes Rs.300 isn't enough motivation. You need something that actually terrifies you.

**Example:** You like a girl. You've been trying to get fit. But you keep skipping gym.

So you set this up:

```
Habit: Go to gym
Penalty Type: Custom Message
If I fail: Send "Hey, just wanted to say I skipped gym again 
because I'm lazy" to [crush's number]
```

Now imagine lying in bed at 6 AM thinking "maybe I'll skip today."

Then you remember: if you don't verify at the gym in the next hour, that message goes out automatically.

Suddenly you're putting on your shoes.

**Or the classic:**

```
Penalty Type: Send Photo
If I fail: Send [embarrassing childhood photo] to [best friend group chat]
```

You uploaded that photo yourself. You chose this. And now you have to live with the consequences if you fail.

CommitT doesn't judge. It just executes.

The best part? You can't delete the stake once it's set. You locked yourself in. Past-you made a decision, and present-you has to honor it.

This is accountability with teeth.

---

## App Blocking (the nuclear option)

CommitT doesn't just remind you. It removes your ability to cheat.

**Example:** Block Instagram from 5 PM to 8 PM daily.

```
Task: Study Time
Time: 5 PM - 8 PM
App Block: Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat
Strict Mode: ON
Penalty: Rs.200
```

At 5 PM, block mode activates. If you try to open Instagram:

```
Instagram is blocked for your commitment.
Time left: 2 hours 58 minutes
```

You literally cannot open it.

**Strict Mode means:**
- Can't uninstall CommitT
- Can't force-stop it
- Can't disable accessibility
- Can't change your phone's time/date
- Can't kill background processes

Try any of that and your accountability partner gets notified. Or penalty triggers immediately.

At 8 PM, apps unlock. You get a message: "Done for today. You stayed disciplined for 3 hours."

## Why this exists

Because willpower is unreliable. Systems work better.

CommitT is basically support wheels for adults. Use it until you don't need it anymore. Then the habits are just... part of you.

## What's this doc for?

Proof that I'm actually building this thing.

Every day I'll post updates:
- What I worked on
- What broke
- What I learned

No marketing fluff. Just real progress.

---

## Why build in public?

Keeps me honest. If I say I'm building something, this doc shows whether that's true or just talk.

Plus maybe someone finds it useful. Or entertaining. Or learns what not to do.

That's CommitT. Let's see where this goes.
