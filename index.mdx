# Welcome to CommitT

👋 **Hey there! I'm Abdul Maajith** — a developer, builder, and someone who's obsessed with turning ideas into reality.

This is CommitT, a project I'm building to solve my own biggest problem: **staying consistent**.

---

There are two kinds of people in this world:

**1️⃣ People who dream.  
2️⃣ People who transform their dreams into reality — no matter the cost.**

For most of my life, I lived in the first category…  
Always planning.  
Always imagining.  
Rarely becoming.

I wasn't lazy.  
I wasn't weak.  
I simply lacked the one thing that separates greatness from potential:

**Consistency.**

Some days I was unstoppable.  
Some days I vanished into distractions.  
I knew exactly who I wanted to become…  
but I kept losing the battle to the version of me that loved comfort.

Then one night, after breaking yet another promise to myself, a thought hit me so hard that it felt like a punch:

> **"What if I had a system that forced me to stay loyal to the life I say I want?"**

Not motivation.  
Not inspiration.  
Not "new year new me."

A *system*.  
A mechanism that makes discipline unavoidable.  
A structure stronger than my excuses.

That night, **CommitT was born.**

## 🌱 The Origin

CommitT didn't start as a startup idea.  
It started as **self-defense against inconsistency**.

I wanted a tool that could:

- Catch me when I slip  
- Push me when I hesitate  
- Remind me when I forget  
- Punish me when I lie to myself  
- And reward me when I show up  

But the most important idea behind CommitT was this:

> **CommitT is not meant to control your life forever.  
> It's meant to support you until the habit becomes *automatic*.**

Just like support wheels on a bicycle.

At first, they guide you.  
They stabilize you.  
They stop you from falling.  

But one day, you remove them — because it's no longer a habit you're trying to build.  
**It has become part of who you are.**

CommitT is that support wheel.  
A temporary external force that slowly becomes an internal identity.

## 🔥 How I'm Using CommitT to Transform My Own Life

Every feature in CommitT came from a real battle *I personally fought*:

### 🏋️ Waking Up & Gym Consistency  
I added **live-photo verification**, **AI challenges**, and **time-locked windows** — no cheating, no excuses.

### 📚 Studying and Skill Building  
I created **focus blocks**, **app restrictions**, and **habit penalties** to stay on track.

### 😤 Fighting Addictions and Bad Patterns  
I built **accountability partners**, **money stakes**, and **automatic consequences**.

### 🎯 Staying Loyal to Long-Term Goals  
I engineered CommitT to speak only truth:  
Either I did it, or I didn't.  
No emotional negotiation.

And slowly… something magical happened.

The app didn't change.  
**I did.**

Things that once required pressure, reminders, and systems…  
became natural.

The support wheels were still there, but I didn't need them anymore.  
My mind had internalized the behavior.

This is the real goal of CommitT:

> **Use external accountability until internal discipline is born.  
> And once discipline becomes identity — the system steps aside.**

## 🌍 Why This Documentation Exists

This isn't just software.  
This is a **movement**.

A movement to prove that:

- Discipline is not genetic.  
- Consistency is not luck.  
- Habits are not magic.  
- And transformation is not for "gifted" people.  

It's for anyone who has the courage to build systems that protect their future.

## 📖 What You'll Find Here

This documentation exists for one reason:

> **Proof of execution.**

Every day, I'll share:
- What I built
- What challenges I faced
- What wins I celebrated
- What lessons I learned

**Full transparency. No filters. No hiding.**

Because building in public isn't just about showing off progress — it's about being accountable to the journey itself.

If I say I'm building something life-changing, this doc will prove it — one day at a time.

CommitT is still evolving.  
But the mission is already clear:

**Transform my life first.  
Then help transform millions more.**

You're early.  
You're witnessing the foundation of something that will go far beyond an app.

Welcome to CommitT.  
The support wheels are on.  
The road is long.  
And the transformation has already begun.
