# February 20th, 2026

**Bug Fixes & Refinements**

Today was focused on ensuring our alarm system is bulletproof and cleaning up the UI experience around pre-alarms.

- **Fixed reliable alarm rescheduling after device reboot:**
  Fixed an issue where alarms were being pushed a week forward after a reboot. This was resolved by reusing the saved `fireAtMs` from device-protected storage when it's still valid.
- **Unified pre-alarm and main alarm UI:**
  - Removed `PreAlarmActivity` and its Toast/TTS logic.
  - Updated `AlarmReceiver` to launch the full-screen `AlarmActivity` for both main alarms and pre-alarms.
  - Passed `isPreAlarm` and `taskTitle` flags so `AlarmActivity` can adapt its text appropriately (e.g., displaying "Upcoming" for pre-alarms).
