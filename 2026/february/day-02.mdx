# February 2nd, 2026

**Status: RESUMED**

The exams are over. We were scheduled to resume on February 3rd, but we are starting **today**.

## The Bounce Back

We spent weeks in academic mode, flushing the cache of this project to make room for exam subjects. Today is about **Context Restoration**.

**The Mission for Today:**
1.  **Recall:** Read through the January logs (especially Jan 18th - the "10 Obsessed Users" pivot).
2.  **Re-orient:** Where did we leave off with the code?
3.  **Resurrection:** Get the dev environment running again.

We are not waiting for tomorrow. Momentum starts now.
