**Robust Alarms & Modular Verification Status UI**

Today's focus was fortifying the Android alarm scheduling chain and polishing the Verification Status UI components.

### Native Android Alarm Reliability
- **Secured Scheduling Chain:** `AlarmReceiver` now immediately re-schedules the next alarm in the background upon waking. This guarantees the chain survives even if the UI is completely constrained, skipped, or swiped away.
- **Silent Mode Bypass:** Enforced silent mode bypass to ensure the user is actively notified.

### Modular Verification Status UI
- **`VerificationStatusCircle`:** Created a universal `VerificationStatusCircle` component to cleanly standardize the UI for condition verification (neutral, verified, failed, partial).
- **Widespread Integration:** Updated `EventDetailModal` and other condition sections to use the new circle component.
- **Design & Layout Polish:** 
  - Implemented text truncation (`numberOfLines={1}`) in `BodyText` and applied it to condition rows to prevent long text from overlapping with the new verification circles.
  - Removed `font-semibold` from All-day, Location, and Condition titles to match the cleaner `BodyText` regular weight design.
  - Replaced tight truncation with `overflow: hidden` on parent containers to ensure text cleanly wraps or hides without breaking the row layouts.

### Global Modal Bug Fixes
- **Double Mount Bug Fixed:** Prevented a duplicate mounting issue where Expo Router was mounting `(main)/_layout.tsx` twice during Stack transitions (especially with the `transparentModal` presentation option). This previously caused two concurrent `EventDetailModal` instances to render.
