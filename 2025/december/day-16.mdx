# December 16th, 2025

**The Day We Redesigned the Schema**

Today was a case study in schema design. We started with a naive approach, hit real problems, and arrived at a metric-based architecture that actually scales. This is the complete journey.

---

## The Problem Context

**Q: What were we trying to build?**

A task/commitment system where users can create tasks with different verification conditions:
- Time (within / outside a time window)
- Location (within a radius)
- App usage restrictions
- AI-based activity verification
- Photo / video proof
- Accountability partner approval

Each task can have multiple conditions, and these conditions will keep growing as new features are added.

**The main challenge:**
How do we design a backend schema that supports unlimited condition types without constantly changing schema or backend logic?

---

## The Initial (Naive) Schema

**Q: What was our first approach?**

Store conditions as attributes directly:

```json
{
  "taskId": "string",
  "conditions": {
    "time": {
      "from": "timestamp",
      "to": "timestamp"
    },
    "appsBlocked": ["instagram", "youtube"],
    "websitesBlocked": ["reddit.com"],
    "aiDescription": ["Studying DSA"],
    "location": {
      "lat": 12.97,
      "lng": 77.59
    },
    "photo": [
      "https://cdn.example.com/photo1.jpg"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this looked good initially:**
- Very readable
- Easy to understand
- Direct mapping from UI to backend
- Felt "clean" and straightforward

---

## Problems with the Initial Design

### Problem 1 — Schema Locks Feature Growth

Every new condition requires:
- Adding a new key in conditions
- Updating backend logic
- Updating validation
- Handling old tasks without the new field

Example: Adding video verification forces schema change:

```json
"video": {
  "minDuration": 30
}
```

**This is a schema migration for every new feature.**

### Problem 2 — Backend Must Guess the Rule

Example:
```json
"appsBlocked": ["instagram", "youtube"]
```

Backend has to guess:
- Is this "never open"?
- Is it "open less than X times"?
- Is it "only blocked during task time"?

**The rule is implicit, not explicit.**

Implicit rules = hidden logic = bugs later.

### Problem 3 — Backend Logic Grows Uncontrollably

Backend ends up with logic like:

```javascript
if (conditions.time) checkTime();
if (conditions.location) checkLocation();
if (conditions.appsBlocked) checkApps();
if (conditions.photo) checkPhoto();
// keeps growing forever
```

Each new condition:
- Adds a new if
- Increases coupling
- Makes backend harder to maintain

**This is hard-coded logic tied to schema shape.**

---

## The Key Insight (Turning Point)

**Q: What was the core realization?**

This is where my friend Atheeq stepped in.

My first approach was bad and naive. I was storing only values and attributes, and expecting the backend to decide the rule. Atheeq suggested the metric-based approach, and at first I didn't fully get why it was better.

But after working through the problems above, I now clearly understand why his approach was better:

**A good schema must also encode the rule intent.**

Backend should execute declared rules, not infer rules.

Thanks Atheeq 👊

## The Metric-Based Schema Design

**Q: What's the new approach?**

We redesigned conditions into a generic rule structure:

```json
"conditions": [
  {
    "metric": "string",
    "relation": "enum(eq|gt|lt|within|outside|exists|matches)",
    "target": {
      "type": "enum(number|string|boolean|array|range)",
      "value": "any"
    }
  }
]
```

This structure is:
- Fixed
- Generic
- Data-driven
- Future-proof

---

## Why a Separate Metrics Definition Exists

**Q: What is the metrics registry for?**

To support and validate conditions, we added a global metric registry:

```json
"metrics": {
  "key": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "unit": "string",
  "allowed_relations": [...],
  "allowed_target_types": [...],
  "permissions_required": [...]
}
```

**Purpose of metrics:**
- Defines what a metric is
- Restricts allowed relations
- Restricts target types
- Declares permissions required

Think of it as:
- `metrics` → what is possible
- `conditions` → what is required

---

## Concrete Example — Location Condition

**Stored condition:**

```json
{
  "metric": "location",
  "relation": "within",
  "target": {
    "type": "range",
    "value": {
      "lat": 12.97,
      "lng": 77.59,
      "radius": 100
    }
  }
}
```

**Metric definition:**

```json
{
  "key": "location",
  "allowed_relations": ["within", "outside"],
  "allowed_target_types": ["range"],
  "permissions_required": ["location"]
}
```

---

## How Backend Evaluates This

**Step 1 — Fetch current user location**

```javascript
const userLocation = { lat: 12.9716, lng: 77.5946 };
```

**Step 2 — Calculate distance**

```javascript
function getDistanceInMeters(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2) {
  const R = 6371000;
  const toRad = (deg) => (deg * Math.PI) / 180;

  const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1);
  const dLng = toRad(lng2 - lng1);

  const a =
    Math.sin(dLat / 2) ** 2 +
    Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) *
      Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) *
      Math.sin(dLng / 2) ** 2;

  return 2 * R * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
}
```

**Step 3 — Evaluate relation**

```javascript
const distance = getDistanceInMeters(
  userLocation.lat,
  userLocation.lng,
  target.lat,
  target.lng
);

if (relation === "within") {
  return distance <= target.radius;
}
```

## Why This Is Scalable

**Q: Does this actually remove if/else?**

No — but here's the important realization:

Yes, if/else still exists — but:
- The number of if/else blocks is fixed per metric
- It does not grow per task
- It does not grow per condition

**Comparison:**

| Old Approach | Metric-Based Approach |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Schema grows → backend grows | Schema fixed |
| New feature → new if | Backend logic fixed |
| Logic tightly coupled to schema | New condition = new data |
| | New metric = one new evaluator |

---

## The Final Learning

**Q: What are the key lessons learned?**

1. Schemas should encode rule intent, not just data
2. Backend should execute rules, not infer them
3. Hard-coding happens when logic depends on schema shape
4. Good abstractions freeze where complexity lives
5. Scalability comes from bounded logic, not fewer lines

---

## One-Line Takeaway

**We don't remove if/else. We control where they live — and keep them from spreading.**

---

## Summary

Today was about schema architecture. We went from:
- My naive attribute-based conditions
- To understanding why that doesn't scale
- To Atheeq's metric-based architecture with explicit rules

The key insight: **Backend should execute declared rules, not infer rules from data shape.**

Honest reflection: My first approach felt clean but was actually a trap. Atheeq saw the scaling problem before I did. Now I understand why — and that's the real learning.
