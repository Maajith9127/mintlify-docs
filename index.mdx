# Hey, I'm Abdul Maajith

I'm building CommitT — an app to help people (mostly me) actually stick to their habits.

The idea is simple: I kept making promises to myself and breaking them. Wake up early? Nope. Go to gym? Maybe tomorrow. Study consistently? Let's not talk about it.

So I thought — what if I built something that makes it really hard to lie to myself?

That's CommitT. It's basically support wheels for your habits. Use it until you don't need it anymore.

## What's this doc for?

Proof that I'm actually building this thing.

Every day I'll drop updates here:
- What I worked on
- What broke
- What I learned
- Random thoughts

No fancy marketing speak. Just real progress (or lack of it).

## Why build in public?

Because it keeps me honest. If I say I'm building something, this doc will show whether that's true or just talk.

Plus, maybe someone finds it useful. Or entertaining. Or a cautionary tale. We'll see.

That's it. Welcome to CommitT.

Let's see where this goes.
