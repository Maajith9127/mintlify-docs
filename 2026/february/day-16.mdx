# February 16th, 2026

**Deep Dive into Event Details & Live Verification**

Today we focused on the depth of the user experience—specifically, what happens when a user clicks an event, and what they see on the home screen "Verification Card."

## 🔍 Event Detail Modal Refactor

We moved the event details from a simple alert to a rich, scrollable bottom-sheet experience.

**Commit:** `Refactor EventDetailModal and centralize event selection state`
- **State:** Centralized `selectedEvent` in the global `useCalendarStore`, decoupling it from local component state.
- **Design:** Updated to a sleek dark theme (`#1A1A1A`) popup.

**Commit:** `feat(EventDetailModal): Refine UI with dynamic Map integration and Status badges`
- **Location:** Added an interactive Google Maps integration that shows the event's geofence.
- **Status:** Dynamic badges now indicate if an event is Verified, Pending, or Failed.
- **Content:** Added clear sections for Description, Time, and Status.

**Commit:** `feat(EventDetailModal): Add scrollable Penalty and Waiver sections`
- **Conditions:** We now visualize the "stakes" of the commitment.
- **Penalties:** Icons for Money, Photo, Message, BlockApp.
- **Waivers:** Icons for Captcha, Paragraph, Intense, Run.
- **Scroll:** Wrapped content in a `ScrollView` to handle long descriptions and condition lists gracefully.

## ⏱️ Verification Card & Live Timer

The home screen card that tells you "What's next?" got a major upgrade.

**Commit:** `feat(VerificationCard): Implement dynamic event fetching and timer`
- **Dynamic Data:** Connected the card to `useCalendarEvents` to fetch the real upcoming pending instance.
- **Live Timer:** Implemented a countdown timer that ticks down to the deadline.
- **Empty States:** Handles scenarios with no upcoming tasks gracefully.

**Commit:** `feat(ui): Enhance VerificationCard loading state with shimmer skeleton`
- **Shimmer Effect:** Replaced static "Loading..." text with a high-quality "Shine-through" shimmer skeleton.
- **SkeletonBlock:** Upgraded our core skeleton component from a simple pulse to a moving gradient shine for a more premium feel.

## 📝 Summary

We transitioned from "displaying data" to "displaying context." The Event Modal now tells the full story of a commitment (Where? What happens if I fail? How do I get out of it?), and the Home Card creates urgency with a live countdown.
