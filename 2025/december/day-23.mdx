# December 23rd, 2025

**The Day We Made Verification a Two-Step Commitment**

Today was not about adding more features. It was about making the verification flow honest, explicit, and impossible to misunderstand. We separated acknowledging a commitment from actually proving it.

---

## Where Verification Starts

**Q: What do I see when I open the app?**

When the app opens, the first thing visible on the home screen is the **Verification card** at the top.

It is not aggressive. It simply shows:

- A title: "Verification"
- A short line: "Start your verification."
- One clear call-to-action: **Start Verification**
- Context about what is coming, for example:
  - Gym
  - "In 2h 30m"

Even before doing anything, the user knows what is coming and when.

---

## What Start Verification Actually Means

**Q: Does Start Verification verify anything immediately?**

No.

Tapping **Start Verification** does not verify anything yet. It is the user saying:

> "I acknowledge this commitment. I am stepping into verification mode."

From there, the flow moves to the **Verify Your Commits** screen.

---

## The Verify Your Commits Screen

**Q: What does the verification screen look like?**

At the top, the screen is intentionally minimal:

- Close icon
- Title: "Verify Your Commits"
- A short explanation that verification is about confirming progress before moving forward

There are no tabs or distractions. It feels like a focused checkpoint, not a dashboard.

---

## The Upcoming Section

**Q: How does the app remind me what I am about to be judged on?**

Just under the header, there is an **Upcoming** section.

It shows, for example:

- Gym
- 6:00 AM – 7:00 AM
- ₹100 penalty
- CAPTCHA waiver

There is a small dropdown indicator so it feels expandable, but even when collapsed it carries enough weight. It quietly says:

> "This is the commitment that will be verified."

---

## The Main Commit Card Structure

**Q: How is the commitment itself presented?**

The main commit card is split into three deliberate sections.

1. **Commit Name**
   - Example: Gym, with an icon
   - This gives the commitment an identity

2. **Conditions**
   - Time window, location, proof type
   - Shown with clear visual cues (clock, map pin, camera)
   - No paragraphs, just structured signals of what counts and what does not

3. **Penalty and Waiver**
   - Example: ₹100 penalty
   - Example: CAPTCHA as the waiver
   - This makes the consequence explicit, not implied

Each section is separated by strong dividers so it does not feel like a soft, generic card. It feels like a contract broken into terms.

Below the card, a **History** section shows past outcomes:

- Verified
- Missed
- Waived

For example: "Gym — Aug 24 — Verified via Photo." Simple, factual, and permanent.

---

## Timing: Before the Window vs During the Window

**Q: What happens if I open this screen before the verification window?**

When the user arrives on this screen before the actual verification window:

- The commit card looks slightly inactive
- The **Verify** button at the bottom is visible but disabled

The message is clear:

> "You have started verification, but it is not time yet."

**Q: How is the Verify button presented?**

The Verify button is pinned to the bottom of the screen:

- Content scrolls
- The button remains fixed

It is always in view, but only becomes actionable at the right time.

---

## When the Window Opens

**Q: What changes when the correct time window starts?**

Once the verification window begins (for example, at 6:00 AM):

- The commit card gains a clear active state
- The Verify button becomes enabled

At that moment, the screen is essentially saying:

> "Now it is time. Prove it."

This is when tapping **Verify** actually triggers verification: photo, video, or whichever proof condition was chosen.

---

## Two-Step Intent: Start Verification vs Verify

**Q: Why separate Start Verification and Verify?**

Because they represent two different actions:

- **Start Verification**  
  The user acknowledges the commitment and enters the verification flow. It is preparation.

- **Verify (at the correct time)**  
  The user proves they did the work. It is evidence.

This separation matters for two reasons:

1. The user cannot accidentally verify early.
2. The user cannot claim they were unaware of what was coming.

The system enforces both awareness and timing.

---

## Why This Feels Like a Discipline Checkpoint

**Q: How is this different from a normal app flow?**

Most apps treat verification as another action: tap a button, toggle a state, mark something as done.

In this flow:

- The user first sees what they promised
- They see what is at stake
- They wait until the verification window opens
- Only then can they prove it or accept the consequence

It feels less like navigation and more like standing at a checkpoint:

- Before it: flexibility and planning
- At it: pressure and decision
- After it: record and consequence

That boundary is what we built today.

---

## What We Actually Built Today

**Q: What is the real outcome of today's work?**

We did not add cameras, sensors, or backend enforcement yet.

Instead, we:

- Defined the start of verification as a conscious acknowledgment
- Separated that from the actual act of proving
- Structured the UI so the user always understands:
  - What will be verified
  - When it will be verified
  - What happens if they do not follow through

We built a clear, two-step discipline checkpoint into the product.
