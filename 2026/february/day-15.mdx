# February 15th, 2026

**Refining the Calendar Experience**

Today was a day of rapid UI iteration. We experimented with different calendar layouts, moving from a single-day view to a 4-day view, and polished the loading states to match the new designs.

## 🎨 Calendar Theme & Layout Refactor

**Commit:** `feat(native): refactor commits screen and customize calendar theme`

We started by cleaning up the `CommitsScreen` layout and customizing the calendar's visual identity.
- **Layout:** Switched `CommitsScreen` to use a `View` container instead of `SafeAreaView` for better control over the fixed header.
- **Theme (`CalendarConfig.ts`):**
  - **Minimalist:** Hid hour column and header borders (set to black).
  - **Contrast:** Darkened and thickened grid lines on day containers.
  - **Typography:** Increased day number font size to **20px**.
  - **Spacing:** Increased `hourHeight` to **80px** for larger, more touchable time slots.

## 🔄 The "Verify" Rebrand & Shimmer Updates

**Commit:** `feat(native): rebrand verify tab and customize calendar appearance`

We officially renamed the "Verify" tab to **"Calendar"** with a new icon, signaling a shift in focus from just verification to holistic schedule management.
- **Shimmer:** Refactored `CalendarShimmer` to match the new 80px row height and black border style.
- **Colors:** Temporarily reverted event colors to use task-based coloring.

## 4️⃣ The 4-Day View Shift

**Commit:** `feat: update calendar to 4-day view and redesign shimmer skeleton`

Late in the day, we made a significant UX pivot:
- **View Mode:** Switched the calendar from a 1-day view to a **4-day view**. This provides users with better context of their upcoming week without the density of a full 7-day view.
- **Unified Styling:** Standardized all events to a single brand color (**#4FA0FF**) with white text and square corners for a clean, uniform look.
- **Skeleton Redesign:** Completely redesigned `CalendarShimmer` to match the 4-day grid.
  - Replaced text placeholders with abstract pulsing `SkeletonBlock` components.
  - Reduced time column width to **15%** to allocate more space to the event grid.

## 📝 Summary

We moved from a granular day-view to a broader 4-day context window. The UI is now darker, cleaner, and uses a unified blue brand color for events.
