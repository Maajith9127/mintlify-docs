# December 19th, 2025

**The Day the Logs Finally Spoke**

Instead of repeating setup steps again, we went lower level. And the logs finally gave us something real.

---

## The Approach Change

**Q: What did we do differently?**

Yesterday was about verifying config. Today was about reading what the system actually says.

We ran:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "Google Maps"
```

---

## The Breakthrough

**Q: What did we find?**

```
INVALID_ARGUMENT – Authorization Failed
```

That one line changed everything.

---

## What This Ruled Out

**Q: What did this error eliminate?**

| Possible Cause | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| React Native Maps issue | ❌ Ruled out |
| Expo vs non-Expo problem | ❌ Ruled out |
| Rendering bug | ❌ Ruled out |
| SHA-1 mismatch | ❌ Ruled out |
| Package name mismatch | ❌ Ruled out |

**The error was authorization-level, not code-level.**

---

## The Expo Maps Experiment

**Q: Did we try anything else?**

Yes. We tried Expo Maps, hoping it might magically work.

It didn't.

Same blank tile. Same authorization error.

---

## The Key Insight

<Note>
**If two completely different libraries fail the exact same way, the problem isn't your code.**
</Note>

That realization should've been comforting — but honestly, it wasn't.

Because now we knew the problem was somewhere else. Somewhere we couldn't easily fix with code.

---

## The Emotional Low

**Q: What was going through your head?**

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I hit a low.

I'm in college. My grades are fucked up.

**Back when I was a topper:**
- Study for exams
- Write papers
- Get marks
- Immediate validation

**Now:**
- I work ten times harder
- Debug cloud configs, SDKs, billing traps
- Build things that are supposed to work in the real world
- And still… nothing works

No marks. No appreciation. No one watching.

Just me, a terminal, and a blank map.

---

## The Thought That Hit

That's when the thought hit:

> *Is what I'm doing even worth it? My grades are fucked up, results aren't coming, and it feels like all this effort is going in vain.*

For a moment, I genuinely felt like a piece of shit.

Not because I failed — but because I put in more effort than ever before, and the outcome was silence.

That hurt more than the error messages.

---

## End of Day 2

The error is clear now: **Authorization Failed**.

But why? Everything is configured correctly.

Tomorrow we stop touching code and look elsewhere.

---

## Summary

Today was about going deeper:
- `adb logcat` revealed the real error: Authorization Failed
- Expo Maps experiment confirmed: not a library issue
- Emotional reality: effort without visible results hits different

The key insight: **When two different libraries fail the same way, the problem is upstream.**

Tomorrow we investigate Google Cloud Console directly.
