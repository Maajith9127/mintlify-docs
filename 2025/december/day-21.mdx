# December 21st, 2025

**The Day We Made the Right Call**

Today wasn't a fallback day. It was a recovery day. A foundation day. A quiet progress day.

---

## Reality Check: Maps

### Important

This was not a failure at maps.

It was paused for the correct reason.

---

## What Actually Happened with Maps

- We **fully explored Maps integration**
- Tried **react-native-maps**
- Verified:
  - SHA-1
  - Package name
  - APK signing
  - SDK enabled
- Still hit **billing + Visa card dependency**

At that point, continuing was **wasted effort**.

---

## Correct Decision Taken

> "Maps is blocked by infra, not by logic."

So we decided:

- **Freeze Maps** — pause development until infrastructure is ready
- Revisit once **Visa card + billing** is sorted
- Stop investing mental energy on something we cannot unlock today

That's not quitting. That's **engineering triage**.

---

## What We Actually Built Today

Today was about **Blocklist UI + structure**

This is *product-level work*, not just UI polishing.

---

## Conceptually: What is Blocklist?

Blocklist =

> "When a commitment is active → restrict distractions."

### Types of blocks

- Apps
- Websites
- AI tools

This was structured properly from the start, not as a hack.

---

## UI Structure Designed

### High-level layout

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│        Blocklist         │
├──────────────────────────┤
│ Apps | Webs | AI  (Tabs) │
├──────────────────────────┤
│ Search bar               │
├──────────────────────────┤
│ [ ] Instagram            │
│ [ ] YouTube              │
│ [ ] Chrome               │
│ [ ] ChatGPT              │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

Simple on the surface, but clean underneath.

---

## Data Flow

### Tabs logic

```typescript
type Tab = "apps" | "webs" | "ai";
```

- One `activeTab`
- One reusable `TabsBar`
- UI reacts purely to state

This approach avoids duplicate screens and conditional rendering complexity.

That's solid React architecture.

---

## TabsBar Component

Tabs were not hardcoded.

Instead:

```typescript
tabs = [
  { key: "apps", label: "Apps" },
  { key: "webs", label: "Webs" },
  { key: "ai", label: "AI" }
]
```

So later:

- Add "System"
- Add "Games"
- Add "Custom"

No refactor needed. Just a data change.

That's scalable UI architecture, not beginner-level implementation.

---

## Search Bar Logic

Even if search isn't fully wired yet:

- The placement is correct
- The architecture accounts for:
  - Filtering
  - Inline typing
  - Future debounce implementation

This demonstrates product thinking, not just visual polish.

---

## State Separation

State was kept separate:

- `activeTab`
- `searchText`
- `inlineText`
- `apps/webs/ai` arrays

This separation prevents:

- State leaks
- UI glitches
- Impossible bugs later

This is a common early mistake that was avoided.

---

## Full Flow Diagram

```
User opens Blocklist screen
        ↓
Default tab = Apps
        ↓
TabsBar renders (Apps | Webs | AI)
        ↓
User switches tab
        ↓
activeTab state updates
        ↓
Corresponding list renders
        ↓
User searches
        ↓
Filtered items shown
        ↓
User selects items
```

No backend needed yet.

No hacks.

Clean mental model.

---

## Critical Evaluation

### What Was Done Right

- Did not force Maps when infrastructure blocked it
- Shifted to high-leverage UI work
- Built reusable components
- Thought in systems, not individual screens

### Key Insights

- Avoid equating productivity solely with infrastructure complexity
- UI and state design is real engineering work
- This blocklist will directly power:
  - Discipline enforcement
  - Value proposition
  - Product differentiation

---

## What This Unlocks Next

Because of today's work, the next steps are clear:

- Wire blocklist to native blockers
- Attach blocklist to commitment lifecycle
- Enforce blocks only during active windows
- Sync blocks via backend later

The foundation was built today.

---

## Final Assessment

Today was not a fallback day.

It was:

- A recovery day
- A foundation day
- A quiet progress day

Maps will come back when infrastructure allows.

But this blocklist UI will be used every single day by users.

That's real, meaningful work.
