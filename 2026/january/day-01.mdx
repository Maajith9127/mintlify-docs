**The Day We Settled the Commit Monorepo**

Today wasn't about adding features.

It was about stopping and asking uncomfortable questions about the structure we’ve already built.

The repo looked clean from the outside.

Inside, it felt massive, confusing, and slightly scary.

This document captures the **exact thought process** — confusion first, clarity later.

---

## The First Question I Asked Myself

**Q: What is a monorepo, really?**

My first explanation sounded like this:

> A monorepo is one giant folder where all apps and servers live together.
> 

That answer is **not fully correct**.

---

## Correcting the Definition (Properly)

**Q: So what *is* a monorepo?**

A monorepo is:

- One Git repository
- Containing **multiple independent projects**
- Managed under a **shared workspace**
- With **explicit sharing**, not accidental coupling

Important correction:

> A monorepo is not one project split into folders.
> 
> 
> It is many projects that agree on rules.
> 

---

## The First Dangerous Misunderstanding

**Q: Does monorepo mean everything can import everything?**

At first, I thought yes.

That idea sounds powerful.

It’s also how monorepos collapse.

---

## What “Sharing Everything Freely” Actually Means (and Why It’s Bad)

If sharing was unrestricted, this would be possible:

```tsx
// apps/native/randomFile.ts
import { internalDbLogic } from "../../packages/backend/internal/db";

```

This looks convenient.

It is poison.

Why?

- Backend internals leak into frontend
- Refactors become impossible
- Build order becomes fragile
- No ownership boundaries

**Healthy monorepos never allow this.**

---

## The Correct Sharing Model

**Q: Then how does sharing work safely?**

By using **explicit packages**.

Example structure:

```
apps/
  native/
  web/

packages/
  config/
  backend/
  monitoring-extension/

```

Only things inside `packages/` are meant to be reused — and only through **public APIs**.

---

## Workspace Packages in Action

**Q: How does one package get used by another?**

Example:

`packages/config/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "@commit/config",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true
}

```

Now in `apps/native/package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@commit/config": "workspace:*"
  }
}

```

### What `workspace:*` actually means

> “Use the version of this package that exists inside this monorepo, not from npm.”
> 

So:

- No publishing
- No version mismatch
- Always local

This is **safe sharing**, not free-for-all sharing.

---

## The TypeScript Confusion

**Q: What is `packages/config/tsconfig.base.json` even doing?**

Here’s the file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}

```

This file does **nothing by itself**.

It becomes active only when another project **extends it**.

Example in `apps/native/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "@commit/config/tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-native"
  }
}

```

Now the rules apply.

---

## Learning TypeScript Rules Through Code (Not Docs)

Let’s use the **exact example we discussed**.

### Base Code

```tsx
const greet = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello ${name}`;
};

```

This works perfectly in modern TypeScript.

---

## What If This Were ES5?

If `target` was `ES5`, TypeScript would **compile this down**:

```jsx
var greet = function (name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
};

```

Arrow functions, template literals — all gone.

So:

> TypeScript doesn’t run in production.
> 
> 
> It *enforces rules* and then disappears.
> 

---

## Strict Mode Screaming at You (Red Lines)

**Q: What happens if I write bad code?**

Example:

```tsx
const greet = (name: string) => {
  console.log(name);
};

```

With `noUnusedLocals: true` and `strict: true`:

- Red underline
- Editor warning
- CI failure (if enforced)

Why?

Because:

- Function returns nothing
- Might be unintended
- Easy bug

TypeScript is not being annoying.

It is preventing silent mistakes.

---

## Another Example: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`

```tsx
const users = ["a", "b", "c"];
const user = users[5].toUpperCase();

```

TypeScript error:

> Object is possibly undefined.
> 

Without this rule:

- Runtime crash
- Production bug

With this rule:

- Forced to handle edge cases

---

## Do Engineers Memorize All These Rules?

**Q: Do real engineers remember every TS compiler option?**

No.

Here’s the real workflow:

1. Senior engineers define the baseline
2. Rules are enforced automatically
3. Developers learn by **writing code**
4. Red lines appear
5. Code gets fixed
6. Standards slowly become instinct

You don’t learn TypeScript rules first.

You **learn by being corrected**.

---

## So Is This Config “A Lot”?

**Q: Is this too much for a project?**

No.

This is:

- one-time setup
- years of safety
- zero runtime cost

TypeScript rules scale *with* the team.

---

## Understanding Bun’s Role

**Q: Why are we using Bun?**

Because Bun provides:

- Fast installs (parallel)
- Built-in runtime
- Native workspace support
- `catalog:` dependency pinning

Example from root `package.json`:

```json
"catalog": {
  "react": "19.2.3",
  "typescript": "^5.9.3"
}

```

Every app now uses:

- same React
- same TypeScript
- no version drift

---

## TurboRepo — The Missing Mental Model

**Q: Is Turbo just about running things in order?**

Partially.

Turbo’s real job is **task graph orchestration**.

Example `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}

```

This means:

> “Before building this project, build all its dependencies first.”
> 

Turbo:

- understands dependency graphs
- caches intelligently
- avoids unnecessary work

This is **build intelligence**, not just scripts.

---

## The Kotlin Reality Check

**Q: Can I write Kotlin in `packages/` and import it into Android?**

No.

Android builds only care about:

```
apps/native/android/app/src/main/java

```

Kotlin must live there to be compiled by Gradle.

Monorepo structure does not override platform rules.

---

## So What Are All Those Other Packages For?

Examples:

- `packages/backend` → Convex backend (Node runtime)
- `packages/config` → shared rules
- `packages/monitoring-extension` → JS tooling / extensions
- `packages/docs` / `fumadocs` → documentation systems

They are **not native Android modules**.

---

## Final Mental Model (The One That Actually Works)

```
Monorepo
│
├─ apps/        → runnable products
│   ├─ native   → React Native + Android
│   └─ web
│
├─ packages/    → reusable, explicit units
│   ├─ config   → rules
│   ├─ backend  → services
│   └─ tooling
│
├─ bun          → installs + runtime
├─ turbo        → orchestration
└─ typescript   → discipline

```

---

## One-Line Takeaway

**A monorepo doesn’t remove boundaries. It forces you to define them clearly.**

---

## Honest Reflection

I wasn’t wrong to feel confused.

The structure *is* complex.

But now the complexity is **named**, **bounded**, and **intentional**.

That’s the difference between chaos and architecture.

# 📘 Metro + Uniwind (Expo) — Q&A Deep Understanding Doc

---

## ❓ Q1: What is Metro?

**Answer:**

Metro is a **development-time software** that:

1. Reads your React Native / Expo code
2. Bundles it into one executable JS file
3. Sends that bundle to the running app (Expo Go / dev build)

👉 Expo Go **cannot read your project files directly**.

👉 Metro is the middleman.

---

## ❓ Q2: What does “bundling” mean exactly?

**Answer:**

Bundling means:

> Taking many JS/TS files and merging them into ONE ordered JS file
> 

Example:

Before:

```
App.tsx
Home.tsx
Button.tsx
auth.ts

```

After (by Metro):

```
index.bundle.js

```

Why?

- Android / iOS want **one entry JS program**
- They cannot follow imports like Node.js

Bundling is:

- ✅ merging
- ✅ ordering
- ❌ not compression
- ❌ not minification (that’s production)

---

## ❓ Q3: Why does `metro.config.js` exist?

**Answer:**

Metro by default understands only **basic JS/TS**.

It does NOT understand:

- CSS files
- Tailwind / Uniwind classes
- custom asset behavior

So `metro.config.js` exists to:

> Teach Metro how to understand extra things
> 

---

## ❓ Q4: Does Expo require `metro.config.js`?

**Answer:**

❌ No — only if you use advanced tools.

If you use:

- plain Expo
- no CSS
- no Uniwind

You can delete it and the app still runs.

You added it because:

- you use **Uniwind**
- you use **global.css**

---

## ❓ Q5: What is `getDefaultConfig(__dirname)`?

```jsx
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

```

**Answer:**

This means:

> “Expo, give me your already-working Metro configuration.”
> 

Why this matters:

- Metro config is huge and complex
- Writing from scratch = easy to break everything
- Expo’s default config already handles:
    - platforms (android / ios / web)
    - assets
    - transformers
    - caching

So you are:

- ❌ not replacing Metro
- ✅ extending a safe base

---

## ❓ Q6: Does the variable name `config` matter?

**Answer:**

❌ No. Metro does NOT care about variable names.

Metro only cares about:

```jsx
module.exports = <object>;

```

All of these are valid:

```jsx
const banana = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
module.exports = banana;

```

```jsx
module.exports = withUniwindConfig(
  getDefaultConfig(__dirname)
);

```

Variable names are for **humans**, not Metro.

---

## ❓ Q7: What is `withUniwindConfig(...)`?

```jsx
const uniwindConfig = withUniwindConfig(config, {
  cssEntryFile: "./global.css",
  dtsFile: "./uniwind-types.d.ts",
});

```

**Answer:**

This line means:

> “Take Expo’s default Metro config, and ADD Uniwind support to it.”
> 

It does **not replace** the config.

It **wraps** it.

---

## ❓ Q8: What problem does Uniwind solve?

Without Uniwind, Metro sees this and gets confused:

```tsx
<View className="bg-black p-4 rounded-xl" />

```

Metro asks:

> “What is bg-black? What is p-4?”
> 

Uniwind solves this by:

- reading Tailwind-like classes
- converting them into **React Native style objects**

---

## ❓ Q9: What does Uniwind ACTUALLY do under the hood?

Conceptually:

You write:

```tsx
<Text className="text-white text-lg font-bold" />

```

Uniwind converts it into:

```jsx
{
  color: "#ffffff",
  fontSize: 18,
  fontWeight: "700"
}

```

Important:

- These are **native styles**
- No runtime CSS
- No DOM
- High performance

Metro then bundles:

- JS logic
- converted styles
    
    together into the final bundle
    

---

## ❓ Q10: What is `cssEntryFile`?

```jsx
cssEntryFile: "./global.css"

```

**Answer:**

This tells Uniwind:

> “This is the root CSS file where Tailwind utilities are defined.”
> 

It includes:

- Tailwind base
- components
- utilities
- custom styles (if any)

Without this:

- Uniwind doesn’t know what classes exist

---

## ❓ Q11: What is `dtsFile`?

```jsx
dtsFile: "./uniwind-types.d.ts"

```

**Answer:**

This is for **TypeScript only**.

It:

- generates typings for `className`
- helps autocomplete
- prevents TS errors

It has **no effect on runtime or performance**.

---

## ❓ Q12: Final mental model (MOST IMPORTANT)

### One sentence to remember forever:

> Metro bundles your app, and Uniwind teaches Metro how to understand Tailwind-style classes and CSS so they become native styles.

---

If you want, next we can:

*   **next** → how this differs from web Tailwind
*   **next** → what happens in production builds
*   **next** → how Metro plugins work in general

This was a **good line of questioning** — you’re thinking like a systems dev, not just UI.
